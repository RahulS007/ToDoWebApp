Database: MongoDB
Backend : NodeJS
Frontend: React

Important Liabraries:
1. For backend node project Monk liabrary is used to connect node to backend.
2. Expressjs is used to create the structure of the node application.
3. For connecting React to backend REST service axios is used.

How the list items are stored:
	I have used MongoDb so no need to worry about any relational discripancies to happen. 
	In general I have created a collection 'todolist' having three fields id, title, completed as required.

Deployment Architecture:
	I am not able to deploy the backend nodejs project with mongodb. Hense just static page is visible.
	The frontend is hosted at https://todolistartscilab.herokuapp.com/

New Experience:
	I had never deployed any application on the web. That was a new experience for me. Definitely there is 
	a big scope for me to learn in that area.
